* TODO Pick font (Preferably FiraCode)
* TODO Main page design
I was thinking if I should separate the wiki part from non-knowledge stuff like
food or book reviews. Think the better question is how should my main page be
organized.
- Recent articles (fosho)
- Work stuff (easy access for potential employers ig)

** TODO scuffed layout (similar to index)
** DONE three.js plant
** TODO dice button (random page)
** TODO dark mode button
* TODO 3D graph of pages
