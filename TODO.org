Write about whatever I want to write about.

* TODO Minor Tasks
** TODO change font (Preferably FiraCode)
** TODO dice button (random page)
** TODO dark mode button
** TODO Astro vs other file types
** TODO linter (maybe prettier)


* TODO Site Architecture
** TODO Page graph system
How to tag pages to "themes"/"topics"?  I think right now tagging pages/essays
to whatever topic node is just fine.
*** TODO Programatically adding node to graph based on existing pages


* DONE
* DONE mobile responsiveness
* DONE Digital garden main page ** DONE look into python graph visualisation
software Think forge-graph is what I'm looking for (2D)
** DONE think about graph structure
I'm guessing its gonna be tags to pages. That makes sense to me.

* DONE Think about how to organize stuff
I guess the graph helps with this part also
* DONE Main page design
I was thinking if I should separate the wiki part from non-knowledge stuff like
food or book reviews. Think the better question is how should my main page be
organized.
** DONE My work/intern experience
** DONE scuffed layout (similar to index)
just do a rough one first, can touch up later
** DONE three.js plant
