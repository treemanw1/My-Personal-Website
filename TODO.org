Write about whatever I want to write about.

* TODO Think about how to organize stuff
* TODO Astro vs other file types
* TODO linter (maybe prettier)
* DONE mobile responsiveness

* TODO Change font (Preferably FiraCode)
* DONE Main page design
I was thinking if I should separate the wiki part from non-knowledge stuff like
food or book reviews. Think the better question is how should my main page be
organized.
** DONE My work/intern experience
** DONE scuffed layout (similar to index)
just do a rough one first, can touch up later
** DONE three.js plant
* TODO dice button (random page)
* TODO dark mode button
* TODO Digital garden main page
** TODO look into python graph visualisation software
Think forge-graph is what I'm looking for (2D)
