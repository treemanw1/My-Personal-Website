# Preface

I started reading this book due to an interest in Javier Milei's policies in
Argentina. That and some interesting discussions about austerity on Reddit.
Perhaps because Reddit is predominantly left-leaning, the general sentiment
there surrounding Milei is largely negative, which further arouses within me an
interest in determining the effectiveness of his policies.

_Why Nations Fail_ seems to go into the idea of institutions, which is something
I am also interested in. On one side you have the US, where political power is
distributed across institutions and where administrative inefficiency is a
feature, not a bug. On the other you have a polar opposite in China where
centralized political power is wielded pragmatically yielding huge economic
growth.

Perhaps because I live in a country considered a flawed democracy, somewhere in 
the middle, the questions of institutions and their longevity is of particular
interest to me.

## 1. So Close and Yet So Different

How historical events shape regional economics. The Spanish modus operandi in
South America for milking locals dry. England's colonial leftovers in Jamestown.
Colonist options besides working like slaves (joining the frontier or Indians)
which in turn led to a change in strategy by top brass to give each colonist man
their own land.

US versus Mexican economic climate in the 1910s. The US with over 27,000 banks
and Mexico with 40. Monopolies in US versus Mexico (Bill Gates versus Carlos
Slim). Mexico with its repeated regime changes.

Why is it that the US and Mexico are so different?

## 2. Theories That Don't Work

Geographical, Cultural, Ignorance.

Prothestants versus Catholics in Europe.

The example of the Ghanian President who pursued unsustainable economic policies
who eventually had to strike a deal with the IMF to devalue the currency. Riots
in the capital and ousted by military coup.

## 3. The Making of Prosperity and Poverty
