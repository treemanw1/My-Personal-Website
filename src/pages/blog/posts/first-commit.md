A tendency to attempt to control how one is perceived can be unhealthy.

I think discomfort can be a good signal for development. Sharing content I create has always made me uncomfortable, though I am not privy to the underlying psychological explanation as to why that is the case.

The traditional format of a blog site with meticulously crafted articles in reverse chronological order is fine, but I feel I would benefit a lot from learning to be comfortable having unfiltered and unpolished content available for anyone to read.
