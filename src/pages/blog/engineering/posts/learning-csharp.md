# Preface

1. Get better at an OOP language. I chose C# because the general online
developer sentiment seems to favour C# more than Java.
2. Become a better backend developer through a feature-first philosophy toward
learning.
3. Get acquainted with the Microsoft stack (?).

Goal: [~1 project](https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas) a week

Minimal APIs and SQLite.

# 2. [Todo API](https://github.com/treemanw1/TodoApi)
7 Feb 25 - 13 Feb 25

A RESTful to-do API with magic link authentication built using ASP.NET Core Web
APIs and Microsoft SQL Server.

# 3. Food Radar
