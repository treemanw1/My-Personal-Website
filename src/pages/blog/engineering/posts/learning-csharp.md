# Preface

This pursuit aims to accomplish a few things:

1. Get better at an OOP language. I chose C# because the general online
developer sentiment seems to favour C# more than Java. 
2. Become a better backend developer through a tool-first philosophy toward
learning.

The goal would be to complete one project a week as rough guideline, according
to [Roadmap.sh's 20 backend projects](https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas)
to become a better developer.

# 1. .NET Blog Backend
28 Jan 25 - 5 Feb 2025

Build a lightweight backend with ASP.NET Core to handle user login and creation
with passkey authentication, and CRUD operations for user comments on articles.

To-do list: 

1. Understand .NET vs .NET Core vs ASP.NET Core
2. Understand MVC vs Minimal APIs
3. Evaluate Git Repository vs Database for storing markdown articles.
4. Evaluate database selection (for comments).
5. Define User flows + Database schema + API endpoints
6. Research hosting options
7. Store articles in Git repository

# 2. Veggie Food Finder

Page that automatically displays the highest rated + cheapest + closest vegetarian food.
