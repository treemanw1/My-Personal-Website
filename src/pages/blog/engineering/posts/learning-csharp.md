# Preface

1. Get better at an OOP language. I chose C# because the general online
developer sentiment seems to favour C# more than Java.
2. Become a better backend developer through a feature-first philosophy toward
learning.
3. Get acquainted with the Microsoft stack (?).

Goal: [~1 project](https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas) a week

# 3. Food Radar
